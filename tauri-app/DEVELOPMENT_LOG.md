# Fuse Development Log

## Cycle: 2026-03-29 (3)

- App: Fuse
- Items completed:
  - [Quality] PR review coverage tracking (P2/S) — `useReviewCoverage` composable with setTimeout-based 5-second threshold tracking per file. Coverage indicator (Eye icon + X/Y count + percentage) in ReviewSession toolbar. Unviewed files marked with teal dot indicator in file tree. Coverage stats shown in session info section.
  - [UX/UI] Split-view diff mode (P2/S) — `viewMode` ref with sessionStorage persistence in DiffViewer. Toolbar with AlignJustify/Columns2 icon toggle. `hunkToSideBySide()` pairing algorithm matching consecutive remove/add lines into left/right columns. Keyboard shortcuts `u`/`s` for unified/side-by-side. Side-by-side panes with independent horizontal scroll.
  - [Feature] Commit-level diff navigation (P2/S) — `useCommitDiff` composable managing commit selection and fetching per-commit diffs via `fetch_commit_diff` and `fetch_commit_range_diff` Rust commands. `CommitPicker.vue` dropdown with click-to-select and Shift+click range selection. Rust commands use GitHub API with diff Accept header. `activeDiffSource` computed in ReviewSession switches between commit-filtered and aggregate diffs.
- Items attempted but failed: none
- Branch: feature/coverage-splitview-commitnav
- Tests passing: yes (vue-tsc clean, cargo check clean, cargo clippy clean excluding pre-existing warnings, cargo test 16/16 passed)
- Build status: pending
- Notes: Three P2/S features enhancing the review session experience. Coverage tracking uses a simple timer approach rather than IntersectionObserver since ReviewSession uses file-selection (one file at a time). Split-view implements a sliding window pairing algorithm for remove/add lines. Commit-level navigation adds two new Rust commands that shell out to `gh api` with the diff Accept header, reusing the existing `parseDiff()` infrastructure.

### Files Created

**Vue/TypeScript:**
- `src/composables/useReviewCoverage.ts` — Automatic file-level coverage tracking with 5-second threshold
- `src/composables/useCommitDiff.ts` — Commit-level diff selection and fetching
- `src/components/CommitPicker.vue` — Dropdown commit picker with range selection

### Files Modified

**Rust:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/diff.rs` — Added `fetch_commit_diff` and `fetch_commit_range_diff` commands
- `src-tauri/src/github/mod.rs` — Added `fetch_commit_diff_async` and `fetch_commit_range_diff_async` functions
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — Registered 2 new commands

**Vue/TypeScript:**
- `src/components/DiffViewer.vue` — Added unified/side-by-side toggle, toolbar, `hunkToSideBySide()` algorithm, keyboard shortcuts
- `src/views/ReviewSession.vue` — Integrated coverage tracking, commit picker, and active diff source switching

## Cycle: 2026-03-29 (2)

- App: Fuse
- Items completed:
  - [Quality] Merge conflict risk detection (P2/S) — `changed_file_paths TEXT` column on `pull_requests` populated during sync. `detect_conflict_risks` command comparing file paths across open PRs grouped by (repo_id, base_branch), returning reciprocal `ConflictRiskEntry` pairs. `useConflictRisk` composable with `risksForPr()` and `pairCount`. `ConflictRiskBadge.vue` component.
  - [Feature] Unified PR review queue prioritisation (P2/S) — Enhanced `get_priority_queue` with `PriorityContext` pre-computing dependency graph, file overlap, and priority label matching. New factors: blocking bonus, blocked penalty, priority label boost, conflict risk factor. New weights: `blocking_weight`, `label_weight`, `conflict_risk_weight`.
  - [Performance] Lazy diff content loading (P2/S) — `get_pr_file_list` command fetching file metadata via `gh pr view --json files`. `useLazyDiff` composable with `fetchFileList` for fast metadata, `expandFile` fetching full diff on first expansion with Map-based caching.
- Items attempted but failed: none
- Branch: feature/conflict-risk-priority-queue-lazy-diff
- Tests passing: yes (vue-tsc clean, cargo check clean, cargo clippy clean excluding pre-existing warnings)
- Build status: pending
- Notes: Three P2/S features implemented across the full stack. Conflict risk detection leverages the new `changed_file_paths` column populated during PR sync, avoiding separate API calls. Priority queue now synthesises five signal dimensions (risk, staleness, blocking, labels, conflict overlap). Lazy diff uses a two-phase approach: fast file list from `gh pr view --json files`, then full unified diff fetched and parsed on first file expansion with all files cached in memory for instant subsequent access.

### Files Created

**Rust:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/conflict_risk.rs` — Conflict risk detection between open PRs
- `src-tauri/src/commands/diff_files.rs` — PR file list fetching for lazy diff

**Vue/TypeScript:**
- `src/composables/useConflictRisk.ts` — Conflict risk fetching and per-PR filtering
- `src/composables/useLazyDiff.ts` — Lazy diff loading with expand/collapse and caching
- `src/components/ConflictRiskBadge.vue` — Conflict risk badge component

### Files Modified

**Rust:**
- `src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs` — Added `GhFileChange`, `ConflictRiskEntry`, `DiffFileSummary` structs; `files` field on `GhPrJson`
- `src-tauri/src/github/mod.rs` — Added `files` to `GH_PR_FIELDS`; `fetch_pr_file_list_async` function
- `src-tauri/src/db/migrations.rs` — Added `changed_file_paths` column migration
- `src-tauri/src/commands/sync.rs` — Added `build_file_paths_json` helper; updated upsert SQL for `changed_file_paths`
- `src-tauri/src/commands/priority_queue.rs` — Added `PriorityContext`, `PRIORITY_LABELS`, blocking/label/conflict factors and weights
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` — Registered `conflict_risk` and `diff_files` modules
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — Registered `detect_conflict_risks` and `get_pr_file_list` commands

## Cycle: 2026-03-29

- App: Fuse
- Items completed:
  - [Feature] PR label-based quick filters (P2/S) — `label_colours TEXT` column on `pull_requests`, `get_all_labels` command aggregating labels with counts and colours, `useLabelFilter` composable with multi-select toggle, colour-coded label pills on PRTable rows, label chip filter bar in PullRequests view.
  - [Quality] Repository sync health monitoring (P2/S) — `get_sync_health` command querying `sync_log` for consecutive failures per repo, `useSyncHealth` composable with `unhealthyRepos`/`hasIssues` computeds, `SyncHealthBanner.vue` warning component.
  - [Feature] GitHub Actions CI check status display (P2/S) — `statusCheckRollup` fetched during sync, `compute_ci_status` helper (passing/failing/pending), `ci_status TEXT` column, CI badge in PRTable status column, CI filter buttons in filter bar.
- Items attempted but failed: none
- Branch: feature/labels-sync-health-ci-status
- Tests passing: yes (vue-tsc clean, cargo check clean, cargo clippy clean excluding 5 pre-existing warnings)
- Build status: pending
- Notes: Three P2/S features implemented across the full stack. Label colours are stored as a JSON map alongside the existing labels JSON array to avoid breaking existing label filtering logic. CI status is computed from GitHub's `statusCheckRollup` field which provides individual check conclusions — the helper reduces these to a single rollup status. Sync health leverages the existing `sync_log` table to detect failure streaks without adding new tracking infrastructure.

### Files Created

**Rust:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/labels.rs` — Label summary aggregation command
- `src-tauri/src/commands/sync_health.rs` — Sync health status per repository

**Vue/TypeScript:**
- `src/composables/useLabelFilter.ts` — Label fetching and multi-select state
- `src/composables/useSyncHealth.ts` — Sync health fetching and unhealthy repo computation
- `src/components/SyncHealthBanner.vue` — Warning banner for failing syncs

### Files Modified

**Rust:**
- `src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs` — Added `LabelSummary`, `SyncHealthStatus`, `GhStatusCheck`, `CiCheck` structs; `label_colours` and `ci_status` fields on `PullRequest`; `color` field on `GhLabel`; `status_check_rollup` on `GhPrJson`
- `src-tauri/src/github/mod.rs` — Added `statusCheckRollup` to `GH_PR_FIELDS`
- `src-tauri/src/db/migrations.rs` — Added `label_colours` and `ci_status` column migrations
- `src-tauri/src/commands/sync.rs` — Added `build_label_colours_json` and `compute_ci_status` helpers; updated upsert SQL to include new columns
- `src-tauri/src/commands/pull_requests.rs` — Updated `PR_SELECT`, `PR_SELECT_WITH_BODY`, `parse_pr_row`, `parse_pr_row_with_body` for new column indices
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` — Registered `labels` and `sync_health` modules
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — Registered `get_all_labels` and `get_sync_health` commands

**Vue/TypeScript:**
- `src/types/index.ts` — Added `label_colours`, `ci_status` to `PullRequest`; new `LabelSummary` and `SyncHealthStatus` interfaces
- `src/components/PRTable.vue` — Label pills with colour styling, CI status badge, `labelPillStyle` helper

## Cycle: 2026-03-25 14:00
- App: Fuse
- Items completed:
  - [Foundation] Integrate @stuntrocket/ui shared component library and design tokens (P1/M) — completed the dark mode migration from data-theme attribute to class-based .dark on html, aligning Fuse with the @stuntrocket/ui convention used across the portfolio. The @stuntrocket/ui package (v0.9.1) was already installed with .npmrc configured and style.css imported in base.css; Poppins font was already loaded via Google Fonts; several @stuntrocket/ui components (SAmbientBlobs, STopbar, SCommandPalette, SButton, SCard, SBadge, etc.) were already in use throughout the app. This cycle completed the remaining work: tokens.css light mode selector changed from [data-theme="light"] to html:not(.dark), useTheme composable switched from setAttribute('data-theme') to classList.toggle('dark'), and index.html inline script updated to remove .dark class for light mode instead of setting data-theme attribute.
- Items attempted but failed: none
- Branch: feature/scooda-design-tokens
- Tests passing: yes (vue-tsc clean, cargo check clean, cargo clippy clean excluding 4 pre-existing warnings)
- Build status: pending
- Notes: The Foundation integration was substantially complete from prior work — @stuntrocket/ui v0.9.1 installed, CSS imported, Poppins loaded, and many shared components already in use. The only remaining gap was the dark mode mechanism: Fuse used data-theme attributes while @stuntrocket/ui expects .dark class on html. This cycle closed that gap with a minimal, focused change across 3 files. The teal accent override (#14b8a6) and all Fuse-specific tokens (risk colours, pipeline track, density mode, focus mode, high contrast mode) are preserved as app-specific additions layered on top of the shared token system.

## 2026-03-22 — Stale Review Detection, Dependency Badges, and Session Auto-Save

### Summary

Implemented three P2/S roadmap items focused on review prioritisation and session resilience. Full-stack changes: Rust backend commands, SQLite schema updates, TypeScript types, Vue composables, and component integration.

### Items Implemented

1. **Stale review detection with reminder notifications** — `get_stale_review_requests` command in `stale.rs` with configurable threshold (`stale_review_hours` setting, default 24h), escalation levels (1/2/3), and local progress detection (checklist + time log). `useStaleReviews` composable with `stalePrMap` and `attentionItems` computeds. "Needs your attention" section on `AggregateDashboard.vue` with escalation badges. Stale review badges on `PRTable.vue` rows (amber at level 1, red at level 2+).

2. **PR dependency awareness with blocking/blocked-by badges** — Existing `pr_dependencies` table and `compute_dependencies`/`get_pr_dependencies` commands leveraged. `PRTable.vue` now accepts optional `dependencies` prop and renders "Blocks N" (red) and "Needs N" (teal) inline badges beside PR titles using computed `blocksCountMap`/`dependsOnCountMap`.

3. **Review session auto-save** — `save_session_snapshot` and `cleanup_stale_sessions` commands in `stale.rs`. `useSessionAutoSave` composable with 30-second interval persistence of reviewed files. Integrated into `PullRequestDetail.vue` with checklist watcher and "Saved" indicator badge. Auto-save starts after secondary data loads and stops/flushes on unmount.

### Files Created

- `src/composables/useStaleReviews.ts` — Stale review fetching and attention item computation
- `src/composables/useSessionAutoSave.ts` — Periodic session snapshot persistence

### Files Modified

**Rust:**
- `src-tauri/src/commands/stale.rs` — Added `StaleReviewItem` struct, `parse_iso_timestamp`, `get_stale_review_requests`, `save_session_snapshot`, `cleanup_stale_sessions`
- `src-tauri/src/db/migrations.rs` — Added `stale_review_hours` default setting
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — Registered 3 new commands

**Frontend:**
- `src/types/index.ts` — Added `StaleReviewItem` interface
- `src/components/PRTable.vue` — Added stale review badges, dependency badges, new props
- `src/views/AggregateDashboard.vue` — Added "Needs your attention" section with stale review items
- `src/views/PullRequestDetail.vue` — Integrated auto-save composable with checklist watcher

### Branch

6. **Configurable review checklist templates per repository** — `checklist_templates` + `checklist_template_items` tables, `commands/checklist_templates.rs` (CRUD), `useChecklistTemplates` composable, `ChecklistTemplateEditor.vue`.

7. **Multi-repository aggregate dashboard** — `commands/aggregate.rs` with cross-repo stats (total open, review-requested, high-risk, stale), top 10 risk PRs, per-repo summaries. `AggregateDashboard.vue` view at `/aggregate` with sidebar nav entry.

8. **PR filter presets** — `filter_presets` table with built-in seed data (My Reviews, High Risk, Stale), `commands/filter_presets.rs`, `useFilterPresets` composable, `FilterPresetsBar.vue` in the PR list view.

9. **PR diff syntax highlighting** — `highlight.js` dependency with 13 language grammars loaded lazily via dynamic import. `useSyntaxHighlight` composable, updated `DiffViewer.vue` with `v-html` highlighted content and custom dark mode colour scheme.
